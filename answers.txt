1. When encrypting a message longer than n, the message, when decrypted, does not decrypt back to the original message, instead returning garbage. This is because, for RSA to work, m must be less than n: m mod n != m when m>n. Therefore, n must be longer than n for successful decryption.

2. Encrypting the message "roll on you bears" results in the same encryption both times, 40507146565317917026445836899311361879. Should an attacker realize this pattern, given that the encryption is the same every time, they could use that information to decrypt it, especially in situations where the message is very small, like "0" or "1".
